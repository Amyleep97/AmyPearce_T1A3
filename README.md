# Intro to this application/Rules to play:

-  You will first be introduced to the game by being welcomed with the sentence " Hello! Welcome to Video Game Trivia!" It will then ask you "Are you ready to begin? Type 'yes' to start " You must type ``` "yes" ```for the questions to begin.

- The first question will apear it should look like this:

- There are 10 Questions to be answered each one is different.

- You must press the enter key after every answer in order to get a result. Always use Capitals at the start of each answer. (example: ``` counterstrike ```will error ```Counterstrike```will work.)

- The appplication will then give you a message depending on if your answer is correct or incorrect. 

- The game will tell you what the answer is if you didn't get it right. 


- At the half way mark the application sends a message saying "You're halfway!" to show your progress.

## Features:

- ``` question = input``` This function will ask the player a question.

- ``` if question == "1996": print("Correct! You're a wizard") score += 1 ``` This function gives the game a scoring system for each question if it is correct this will add 1 point.

- ``` else: print("Incorrect, sorry gamer :( The answer is 1996") ``` This function makes sure that if the answer is incorrect it does not tally a score and will tell you what the correct answer is.
