# Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

- Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.


# List of features that are included in the application:

1. This Trivia has 10 questions each question will be a challenge but becomes harder as the questions go on. The purpopse is to not only get the player thinking but to get them to also learn something about video games that they may have not known before the trivia.

2. You can have as many guesses as you like it will return a message, I thought this idea would be fun! It'll give the trivia a little bit of personality by saying things like "Almost! keep trying" Making it seem smarter than the actual player
    
3. At the very end you will be able to see your all round score of how many questions you got correct. The main reason a trivia is played is to see how much knowledge the person has on the main them. 

- describe each feature, providing a walkthrough of the logic of the application.


# Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- error handling


Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .


# Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

- Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

- Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

- checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
